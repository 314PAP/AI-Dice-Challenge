# ðŸŽ² Turn Logic Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Banked Dice Not Clearing at Turn Start
**Problem**: Banked dice from previous turn remained visible when a new turn started.

**Root Cause**: `bankedDiceThisTurn` was being cleared in `nextPlayer()` but the UI wasn't updated properly.

**Solution**: 
- Moved the clearing of `bankedDiceThisTurn` to `playerTurn()` for better visual timing
- Added explicit clearing in the human player turn setup in `endTurn()`
- Ensured `updateGameDisplay()` is called after clearing banked dice

**Files Modified**:
- `src/js/game/controllers/gameFlowController.js` - Clear banked dice in playerTurn()
- `src/js/game/gameState.js` - Updated nextPlayer() comment

### 2. Infinite Loop After Human Turn
**Problem**: After a human player ended their turn, the game would continue automatically instead of stopping at the next human player.

**Root Cause**: `endTurn()` was always calling `playerTurn()` at the end, which would automatically start AI turns.

**Solution**:
- Modified `endTurn()` to only call `playerTurn()` for AI players (currentPlayer !== 0)
- For human players, only update the UI to show it's their turn but don't auto-start
- Fixed FARKLE handling to use proper `endTurn()` call instead of direct `playerTurn()`

**Files Modified**:
- `src/js/game/controllers/gameFlowController.js` - Conditional playerTurn() call
- `src/js/game/controllers/turnActionsController.js` - FARKLE handling fix

## Code Changes

### gameFlowController.js
```javascript
// Before: Always called playerTurn() 
updateGameDisplay();
playerTurn();

// After: Conditional based on player type
updateGameDisplay();

// Only automatically continue for AI players
if (gameState.currentPlayer !== 0) {
    playerTurn();
} else {
    // Update UI for human player but don't auto-start
    updateActivePlayer();
    updateGameDisplay();
    // Clear banked dice display for new turn
    gameState.bankedDiceThisTurn = [];
    updateGameDisplay();
}
```

### turnActionsController.js  
```javascript
// Before: Direct playerTurn() call on FARKLE
playerTurn();

// After: Proper endTurn() call
const { endTurn } = await import('./gameFlowController.js');
endTurn(false); // false means no score (FARKLE)
```

### playerTurn() Function
```javascript
// Added banked dice clearing at the start of each turn
gameState.bankedDiceThisTurn = []; // Clear banked dice display at start of new turn
```

## Testing
- Created test page: `test_turn_logic.html` to verify fix functionality
- Verified dice clearing works correctly
- Verified turn flow stops at human players and doesn't auto-advance
- Confirmed FARKLE handling works properly

## Expected Behavior Now
1. **Turn Start**: Banked dice from previous turn are cleared from display
2. **Human Turn**: Game waits for human player to manually roll dice
3. **AI Turn**: Game automatically plays AI turn  
4. **Turn End**: Game advances to next player but stops at human players
5. **FARKLE**: Properly ends turn and advances to next player (but stops at human)

## Status
âœ… **FIXED**: Banked dice clear properly at turn start
âœ… **FIXED**: No more infinite loop - game stops at human players
âœ… **TESTED**: Both fixes verified with test page and development server
